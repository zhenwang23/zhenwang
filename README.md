Introduction about Me
I am Zhen, currently working for Jina AI.
I am from Beijing and live in Berlin, Germany now.
I already received nine years of compulsory education as well as undergraduate and graduate education in Beijing before leaving China. At that time I had a strong interest in nature, so I studied ecology as my major. I explored the world by learning and researching about the bird migration.
Later I moved to Germany to pursur my PhD. After I received my degree in evolutionary ecology, I got off the track and started working in other fields.
I joined Jina in 2020 as an initial member. In order to help the team grow, I am trying to brush up on my knowledge of AI and programming in order to become a core member of the team that will drive its growth.
